            <p>My name is Shashank Beri, and I attend Dublin High School, Dublin, CA. I enjoy playing sports and giving back to the community. The world around us is revolving around technology, consequently drawing me towards the digital world that we live within. A goal that I set myself for high school is to graduate with a diploma and attend a four-year college. I chose this goal because this gives me the initiative to further my education to establish a career pathway that I would enjoy.</p>
            <p>I am an outgoing type of person that wants to get the job done in the most comfortable and most efficient. This is an excellent quality that enables me to be a good leader and help teams thrive when needed. I am smart and relentless, which allows me to succeed when working on projects. This attitude helps me think of great ways to complete projects most comfortably and efficiently. I am pretty versatile and can adjust to almost any job that needs to be done, making it ideal for a team to get the most amount of work done. These qualities are not just for academics, but I use them to be a good athlete. These qualities help me strive for my goal and pushes me to be the best basketball player I can be. Some achievements that I have had in high school are, being on the Freshman Dublin basketball team, placing second in the Alameda County Science and Engineering Fair, and excelling in many advanced courses I have taken. Some work skills that I have attained by doing a lot have taught me to be persistent. Being knocked down does not mean that I should give up on my goal. I should also work efficiently to propel myself towards my goal, making me do the best on each thing that I do. This is a great thing to have when working in the field because there are many instances where you need to have excellent characteristics to excel.</p>
            <p>This wraps up what makes up me. Thank you for taking the time and reading about me. I hope that you stick around to check out the rest of my website, exploring projects and events that I have completed. To contact me, head over to the Contact Me page and send me an email. I hope to see what is in store throughout high school. I will continue to embark on my journey and work towards being a better engineer. Thank you for your time, and I hope you check out the rest of my website.</p>

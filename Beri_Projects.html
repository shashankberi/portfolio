            <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
            <h4>Course: Computer Science Principles (CSP)</h4>
            <h5>Duration: 8 Days (September 3, 2019 - September 11, 2019)</h5>
            <h5>Objective: Create either a game or a story that is fun and interactive using Scratch.</h5>
            <h5>Type of Project: Partner Project</h5>
            <p>This project challenged my partner and I to think of a way to engage people with a game or story. The project pushed us to think outside of the box and create a game that was not only fun but challenging.  We went through a rigorous brainstorming process, where we ultimately decided to create a game. After choosing a game, we started another process of brainstorming, this time focusing on the type and objective of the game. We then decided to create a platformer game where the block, or player, would move around and jump off walls to complete the levels. Using Scratch, we programmed our game, including many obstacles and challenges that required a level of critical thinking to solve. My partner and I were able to work well together, enabling us to work efficiently and quickly on our game. Subsequently, our peers gave us positive feedback on our project, as they were able to enjoy the many challenges our game threw at them.</p>

            <h3>Game Theory Porject</h3>
            <h4>Course: Computer Science Principles (CSP)</h4>
            <h5>Duration: 10 Days (February 10, 2020 - February 19, 2020)</h5>
            <h5>Objective: Create a strategy that allows for the user to avoid the most jail time and gaiun the most points. </h5>
            <h5>Type of Project: Partner Project</h5>
            <p>This projecct pushed my partner and I to think out of the box and create multiple strategies. We constantly used trial and error to create the best strategy. Our brainstorming process began with creating a fre simple strategies to test it out on. After that, we attempted to create a more complex strategy. However, we found that our simple strategy of betraying 75% of the time and colluding 25% percent of the time was more effective. We submitted our code to our teacher, where he simulated a tournament of Repl.it. In that tournament, we got 1st place 8 out of 10 times, showing that our code was very effective. My partner and I worked very well together, which allowed us to brainstorm and create many strategies. Because of our team chemistry and team work, we were able to place first overall in our class.</p>
